01 PySide2 and Qt.py installed via PIP.  Using Anaconda to manage my python 
environments 

02 Created a simple UI and tested the buttons run the 2 functions.

03 This section I just followed your videos and got familiar with the designer
I wanted to focus my efforts on my tool so really just spent my time following
to understand better what does what in QT Designer.

04 Created a UI for my application and wrote the application during the last 4
weeks.  Had to learn about setting up my python environments and test and select
modules I felt solved the problem best.  I built some tools to assist in creating
nuke node structures from scratch.  This tool is at the root of this repo.

A video was created to show it working.  It is not integrated within Nuke due
to the libaries in use and more than liekly not compiled to the same version
that nuke 13 is using.


05 Form filled in :-D
